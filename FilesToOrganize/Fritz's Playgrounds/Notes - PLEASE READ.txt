All of these playgrounds are completed 100%, but may need slight tweaking.
 
The fishing is not done there are some things that need to be added/fixed to it
and the fishing is based off of the fishing from 2003 with the reel.
 
I have included the *.eggs of the phase_14 files incase of texture problems
so you can change the locations of the textures and compile if necessary.
 
"streets.py" and "specialHoods.py" need to be added in.
 
Funny Farm needs to be accessed only if you type in Funny Farm in the
codes section of your book because it is no ready by tunnel yet.
