This is a list of things to-do.
If you find any bugs, put it here!
If they are fixed, basically add FIXED next to them
If they are fixed but some minor things are to do, then add ALMOST FIXED
If not of thoses above, then just NOT FIXED YT

Features:
If a feature is done, just add DONE
If a feature, is done but needs some tweaking/almost finished, add ALMOST DONE
WHY DID YOU DESTROYED MY TODOH U_U
If a feature is not done but being made, add BEING MADE
if they aren't done, then just add TO BE MADE

BUGS TO FIX:

HIGH PRIORITY - CANNOT CREATE OR DELETE TOONS, PLEASE SEE http://pastebin.com/M7uhDPa9

FIXED - Frozen book animation when closing the book (i dont know why)

NOT FIXED YET - When spawning in an area, the running sounds plays even with no movement.

ALMOST FIXED - Player can open stihcker WHILE in trolley and tunnel. (almost) (FIXED i think)


NOT FIXED YET - Choosing a toon type and then coming back shows cat instead of the current type.

NOT FIXED YET - Random teleport spawns into gray area. (HUH? ~loblao)

NOT FIXED YET - Double clicking the shticker crashes the game

NOT FIXED YET - Reverse makes the same sound as running. needs to be walkloop
Also, sometimes, walking gives the backwards animation, and it means you have to repress w to fix it

NOT FIXED YET - Toons get out of the tunnel in neutral position.

NOT FIXED YET - Bubbles always look large... while chatting.

NOT FIXED YET - Sound stops at the half of it (aka tp by example)

NOT FIXED YET - Opening the book while teleport results in a crash

NOT FIXED YET - Adding someone removes your toons. (Notsure) <--- sounds very important!!

NOT FIXED YET - Hop of button stays after quitting...

NOT FIXED YET - Neutral and teleport animation are mixed together, and that causes a really strange... buggy anim.

NOT FIXED YET - Wrong animation for jumping while running.  Wrong animation when pressing forward and left/right.

NOT FIXED YET - Jumping animation begins whether or not toon is touching the ground.

THINGS TO IMPLEMENT/Fix:
DONE        - Teleport fixes - Aka, teleport out animation when joining a neighborg/tping, and give the toon a teleport hole
DONE        - Shadow Under TOON
DONE        - The TAG (Need to make it mobile.)

ALMOST DONE - Chat (Needs a few things done...)
ALMOST DONE - Funny Farm and Acorn Acres street
