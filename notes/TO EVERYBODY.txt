Hi there,
I just have Internet again and I saw how TTH evolved. Badly. So I ask you just some things :
1-Please, on the 1st of February, migrate to Google Drive and IRC. Im gonna remove the Skype Chat on this date, and you should remove the Dropbox folder.
2-Some people must be "fired". Because they do nothing.
3-Reorganize the team. Too messy I think.

Thanks,
~s0r00t
PS : 5 people of the team may be contacted by me
